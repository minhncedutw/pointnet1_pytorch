# pointnet1_pytorch
This repo is implementation for [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) in pytorch based on [pointnet.pytorch repository](https://github.com/fxia22/pointnet.pytorch).

## Guide using
1. Run pointnet1_pytorch/Shapenet/download.sh to download Shapenet dataset
2. Run [train_segmentation](https://github.com/minhncedutw/pointnet1_pytorch/blob/master/train_segmentation.py) to train network
3. Run [show_seg](https://github.com/minhncedutw/pointnet1_pytorch/blob/master/show_seg.py) to test segmentation of network
